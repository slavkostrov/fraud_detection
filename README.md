## fraud-detection

Repository for solution of fraud detection problem with modern machine learning algorithms that will provide high quality and best values of buisness/ML metrics.

### Main Purposes:
* Main purpose, as said earlier, is to solve fraud detection problem using ML algorithms.
* So final ML model must answer to all of constraints and acceptance criterias.
* In project must be used modern libraries and technologies related to Data Science subject.

### Metrics of project: 

Accord to problem description, the primary goal to return precise alerts, as investigators might ignore further alerts when too many false alarms are reported. So first metric wille `Precision` of Fraud class, which can be calculated from values of confusion matrix. With this metric we aim to minimize false alarms of our model.

But only with Precision metric our model may be bad. So we introduce second metric - `Recall` of Fraud class.
